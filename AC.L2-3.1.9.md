# AC.L2-3.1.9

Goal: Provide privacy and security notices consistent with applicable CUI rules.

Tasks:

- Verify [banners](../banners.md) meet the requirements. May need to add blurb about CUI requirements imposed by Department of Defense.
- Draft and implement privacy notices on all services storing CUI.

User Impact:

- On systems that support this, users must accept the login banner before accessing the system.
