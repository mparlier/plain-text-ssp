# AC.L1-3.1.22

Goal: Be able to show evidence of a process for verifying and approving public release of information. Show documented procedures for walking back published information in case of accidental CUI exposure.

Tasks:

- Access Control Policy, Public Release Policy. Identify Role within the company that includes people who have the authority to publish company information.
- Develop approval process for publishing content to verify FCI/CUI information is not included. Jira Work Management? Simple ticketing system?
- Public Information Release Authorization procedures.

Document procedures for each public system we use for publishing information to include removing and addressing improper posting of CUI. Make these procedures available to all who have the authority to publish information. This might require research on those public systems to see if they provide that capability (to remove a post).
