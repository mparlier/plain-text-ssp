# SC.L2-3.13.8

Goal: Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of CUI during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards.

Tasks:

- Document - Identify the use of FIPS validated security modules/methods for securing CUI both at rest and in transit.
- Document - coordinate with SaaS vendors to get Shared Responsibility Matrix and FIPS validated encryption methods for information at rest and in transit.
- Enforce full disk encryption on all endpoints
- Purchase FIPS validated hardware to replace any hardware that does not meet this standard
