Goal: Ensure that managers, systems administrators, and users of organizational systems are made aware of the security risks associated with their activities and of the applicable policies, standards, and procedures related to the security of those systems.

Tasks:

- Security Awareness and Training Policy.

"PDW provides security awareness training to all information system users (including managers, senior executives, and contractors) as part of initial training for new users when required by system changes and at least annually thereafter. Users will receive initial security awareness training as part of in-processing requirements, and all employees will require refresher training annually or after a policy change."

Define Policies, Standards, and Procedures within the policy. For instance,

- Enroll all employees in purchased training software.
- Put together awareness training program that target specific roles within the company (i.e., General User, System Administrator, Senior Executive).
- Set up email phishing simulation procedures and policy.

User Impact:

- All employees will be required to attend security awareness training when they are hired and once a year after that.
- Employees will routinely receive phishing email simulations to test security awareness.
