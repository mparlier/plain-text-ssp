# AT.L2-3.2.3

800-53 Controls: AT-2(2)

Goal: Provide security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.

Tasks:

- Awareness and Training Policy.

"PDW has established and maintains an Insider Threat Program that gathers, integrates, and reports relevant and available information indicative of a potential or actual insider threat as required. Insider Threat is discussed in the annual briefing and is part of all employees' annual security refresher training. This course explores a variety of security topics which include Insider Threat Awareness, Counterintelligence, and Reporting Requirements. This training is intended to refresh employees on responsibilities and methods to properly safeguard CUI and other sensitive information and thereby contribute to the National Security of the United States. Regular communications to employees are made throughout the year from Security."

"Potential indicators and precursors of insider threat include behaviors such as: inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or sexual harassment of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies, procedures, directives, rules, or practices of organizations. Security awareness training includes how to communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat through appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established organizational policies and procedures. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness training topics to the role (e.g., training for managers may be focused on specific changes in behavior of team members, while training for employees may be focused on more general observations)."

User Impact:

- Routine emails from Security on how to spot Insider Threat.
