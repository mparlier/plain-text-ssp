Goal: Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations.

Tasks:

- Data Flow Diagram.
- Access Control Policy.
- Procedures for utilizing Access Control Lists for where data resides. How do we manage that information flow between the in-scope systems.
- Data may not be shared with external parties without authorization. How do we enforce this? (SharePoint, Atlassian, etc.)
- Data Loss Prevention procedures. How do we make sure CUI remains where we tell it to?
- Information Flow Control Policy. Who authorizes the flow of FCI/CUI information to subcontractors?
- Email security.
- Network Diagram - network segmentation using VLANs.
- Update firewall flow control policies (both inbound and outbound)
