# AC.L2-3.1.20

Goal: Make sure controlled data stays within the boundary of in-scope systems.

Tasks:

- Data Flow Diagram - Identify all external contractor systems that are out-of-scope and how those connect to and from our system. (a,b)
- Access Control Policy - Only approved devices may be used to access in-scope systems.
- Data Loss Prevention - Limit access to external systems.
- Conditional Access - only devices that meet certain criteria may access. Any way to force manual approval of all devices?
- Personal mobile devices - Configure M365 to force manual approval of these devices.
- VPN with MFA to local LAN networks.

## Use of External Information Systems

External information systems are information systems or components of information systems that are outside of the PDW authorization boundary for which PDW, Cage Code 91E11, has no direct supervision or authority over the application of required security controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information systems include, for example:

- Personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants);
- Privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping malls, airports);
- Information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and
- Federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of PDW.

## Limits on Authorized Use

PDW maintains contractual relationships with external parties to store, process, and transmit CUI. Any new connections will require Program Management approval and must meet these contractual obligations:

- Establish terms and conditions
- Verify security control implementation on external system
- Restricts or prohibits the use of non-organizationally owned information systems, system components, or devices to process, store, or transmit organizational information.
