# AC.L1-3.1.2

Goal: Show where data flows and how we restrict access to that data based on user roles and NTK.

- Make sure Data Flow Diagram is up to date to show flow of CUI and ITAR information.
- Implement Access Control Lists on CUI/ITAR data.
- Employee roles are identified (Business Development, Developer, Sysadmin, etc.).
- Employee rights to CUI/ITAR are identified. For instance, keep record of those employees who do not have export licenses for ITAR data.
- Track all external parties and verify contractual information.
